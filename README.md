## Running project

To run this project locally first I suggest having PHP MySQL Apache environment installed, for example Bitnami WAMP/MAMP. Then:
1. Clone the repo to htdocs folder in apache2
2. Change smtp server information to use your own mail. If you use gmail just change username and password (fetched from file on server at the moment to not show password in source code) on htdocs/functions/sendmail.php
3. run installation script on http://localhost:8080/config/setup.php
4. Use app on http://localhost:8080/

To make use of webcam features you have to allow the site to access your webcam with your browser.
